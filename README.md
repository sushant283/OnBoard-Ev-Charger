                                        On-Board EV Charger
Overview
This repository contains the design, implementation, and documentation for an advanced on-board electric vehicle (EV) charger. The charger supports three modes of charging: grid, solar, and regenerative braking, providing a versatile and efficient solution for EV owners.

Features
Grid Charging: Connects to standard electrical grids for convenient and reliable charging.
Solar Charging: Integrates with solar panels to utilize renewable energy, reducing carbon footprint and energy costs.
Regenerative Braking: Harnesses energy from braking to recharge the battery, enhancing overall efficiency and range.

Components
Power Management System: Ensures optimal distribution of power from different sources.
DC-DC Converter: Converts energy from solar panels and regenerative braking to a usable form for the battery.
Control Unit: Manages the charging modes and ensures seamless switching between them.

Installation
Grid Charging: Connect the charger to a standard electrical outlet.
Solar Charging: Integrate with existing solar panel systems.
Regenerative Braking: Connect to the vehicleâ€™s braking system to capture and convert kinetic energy.
